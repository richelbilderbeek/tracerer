## What is the idea behind the logo?

The logo consists of a rough redraw of Tracer, from the Blizzard
game 'Overwatch', and the R logo. 

## What are the FASTA files?

FASTA files `anthus_aco.fas` and `anthus_nd2.fas` from:

Thanks to Paul van Els.

## Why the logo?

Initially, the logo was a low-tech remake of Tracer, from the game Overwatch by Blizzard. 
To prevent problems with Blizzard, a different logo was picked.

The current logo shows an ant, an animal that leaves a trace of pheromones.
The any is drawn by Jose Scholte, who kindly allowed her work to
